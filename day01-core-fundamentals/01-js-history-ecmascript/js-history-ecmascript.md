# JavaScript History & ECMAScript (Intermediate)

JavaScript was created in 1995 with the goal of enabling client-side scripting.
It was not originally designed for large-scale applications.

## ECMAScript Standard

ECMAScript is the **official language specification** that defines:
- Syntax
- Semantics
- Core language features

JavaScript engines implement ECMAScript standards.

## Evolution Timeline

- ES5 (2009): Stability and wide browser support
- ES6 / ES2015: Major language redesign
- ES2016+: Incremental improvements every year

---

## Why ES6 Changed Everything

ES6 introduced:
- Block scoping (`let`, `const`)
- Arrow functions
- Classes
- Modules
- Improved asynchronous handling

Modern JavaScript development assumes ES6+ by default.

## Practical Implication
Understanding ECMAScript versions helps you:
- Read legacy code
- Write future-proof code
- Debug cross-browser issues
