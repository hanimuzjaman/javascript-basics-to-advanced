# JavaScript Runtime Environments (Intermediate)

## Runtime vs Language
JavaScript alone cannot:
- Access files
- Access DOM
- Perform network I/O

These are provided by the **runtime**.

---

## Browser Runtime
Provides:
- DOM (Document Object Model)
- BOM (Browser Object Model)
- Web APIs

---

## Node.js Runtime
Provides:
- File system access
- Process management
- Networking primitives

---

## Practical Implication
JavaScript behavior = **Language + Runtime APIs**
